# Machine Learning Regression Model for California Housing Dataset

This repository contains a machine learning regression model built for the California Housing dataset. The goal of this project is to predict housing prices in various regions of California based on a set of features.

## Dataset

The California Housing dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning and is available in the `data` directory of this repository. The dataset includes various features such as the median income, average house occupancy, latitude, longitude, and more. The target variable is the median house value in a given region.

## Model

The machine learning model in this project is designed to perform regression, specifically predicting the median house value. The model has been implemented using Python and leverages popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.


## Results

After training and evaluating the model, the performance metrics and visualizations will provide insights into the accuracy and effectiveness of the regression model. Use these results to understand the model's behavior and make informed decisions.
